	    <p class='pages'>I started the way in programming on my own. It was difficult and incomprehensible. But with each line of code it became easier. Now I don’t know how to tear myself away from the computer if I am looking for a solution. And I think that is the most important thing. The interest is my motivation.</p>
		<p class='pages'>I always wanna do something incredible, change the world or people minds. Because of it my first profession is journalism. But words aren’t everything. There are big field between. Field of sense, another vision of life. Today sites are your face, your image. Often all information about you will be searched on the Internet. Let’s make it perfect.</p>
